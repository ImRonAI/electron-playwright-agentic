# Playwright/Electron MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that combines Playwright automation with
Electron-native control. It can drive the user's current Electron UI via CDP,
run Electron API calls (when hosted in the main process), and optionally embed
an automation surface (iframe/webview) that the user can see.

## Capabilities (and how Electron APIs are integrated)

### 1) UI Automation (the user's current Electron window)
- Uses Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) to attach to the focused Electron
  `webContents`.
- The MCP connects via `--electron-bridge-url` and receives the active target
  ID automatically.
- Result: Playwright actions operate directly on the exact UI the user is
  looking at.

### 2) Electron API access (main process integration)
- When the MCP server runs inside Electron's main process, it can call
  Electron APIs directly.
- The MCP exposes Electron API tools (`electron_api_*`, `electron_handle_*`,
  `electron_eval_main`) that operate on the actual Electron module.
- This allows app-level control: windows, paths, dialogs, app state, native
  integrations, etc.
- These API calls are gated by flags (`--electron-allow-all-apis`,
  `--electron-allow-unsafe-eval`) and are OFF by default.

### 3) DevTools and low-level CDP control
- Tools like `electron_devtools_*` and `electron_cdp_send` allow deep
  inspection, diagnostics, and automation.
- Destructive CDP operations are blocked unless explicitly enabled
  (`--electron-allow-destructive-cdp`).

### 4) Embedded visible automation surface
- If your app exposes an iframe/webview, the MCP can target it using:
  `--electron-iframe-selector` + `--electron-iframe-type`.
- Result: agent actions are fully visible to the user.

### 5) Headless automation
- Use headless mode for background tasks with no UI shown:
  `--electron-mode headless --electron-headless-target electron`

## Agent connection (stdio) - required args

### UI (focused tab)
```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "/Users/timhunter/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ronbrowser/agent/tools/mcp/mcp-playwright/dist/index.js",
    "--electron-mode", "electron",
    "--electron-bridge-url", "http://127.0.0.1:9231"
  ]
}
```

### UI + iframe (visible automation inside app)
```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "/Users/timhunter/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ronbrowser/agent/tools/mcp/mcp-playwright/dist/index.js",
    "--electron-mode", "electron",
    "--electron-bridge-url", "http://127.0.0.1:9231",
    "--electron-iframe-selector", "<CSS_SELECTOR>",
    "--electron-iframe-type", "iframe"
  ]
}
```

### Headless (no visible UI)
```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "/Users/timhunter/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ronbrowser/agent/tools/mcp/mcp-playwright/dist/index.js",
    "--electron-mode", "headless",
    "--electron-headless-target", "electron",
    "--electron-bridge-url", "http://127.0.0.1:9231"
  ]
}
```

### Optional switches

- --electron-iframe-type webview|webcontentsview
- --electron-allow-unsafe-eval
- --electron-allow-all-apis
- --electron-allow-destructive-cdp (off by default; only enable if explicitly
  allowed)
